    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 Powdered Metallic Aluminium</li>
        <li>3/4 Powdered Iron Oxide</li>
        <li>A strip of Magnesium</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>Directions</h3>
   <ol>
        <li>Use ceramic containers rather than metals to minimize fire risk.</li>
        <li>Use powdered iron oxide, aluminium powder, and a strip of magnesium</li>
        <li>Dry out your iron oxide in an oven or over a Bunsen burner. Set the oven on a medium temperature, such as around 200 째F (93 째C). Heat the iron oxide for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Mix the aluminium powder and iron oxide on a sheet of paper. Add 3 grams of aluminum powder and 9 grams of iron oxide. Swirl the metals together or shake them between 1 piece of paper and another. Continue to blend until they are fully mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a ceramic container, such as a clay flower pot. Then insert the magnesium strip into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Light the magnesium strip with a propane torch or stick lighter and ENJOY THE SHOW!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Safety precautions and things you should know</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thermite is a 1:3 mixture (by mass) of metallic aluminium and iron oxide. It burns at 2,200째C (3,990 째F), producing molten iron, and is often used for welding.[</li>
        <li>Making thermite is extremely dangerous. Take safety precautions like wearing a welding mask, fireproof apron, and protective clothing.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to extinguish burning thermite with water. Let it burn out. Never remove your safety gear when working with thermite.</li>
    </ul>
